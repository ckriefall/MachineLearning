# Outline of Project
Project Overview and Background

Project Outputs

Approach

Load libraries and data

Narrowing the training set to exclude various non-measurement columns

Subset training data provided to test algorithms

Run three models from the train function from the Caret package

Models are trained, now apply the models to the validation set to check accuracy

Model Comparison

Confusion Matrices show deeper analysis of model comparision

Apply Chosen Model, Random Forest to original test data

Conclusion
